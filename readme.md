# Turn Timer
If the gap between note chunks is around 16 steps (1 measure), then the dial appears (changes depending on time signature)!
***MOBILE WAS NOT IN MIND WHEN MAKING THIS MOD!*** Though it will be accounted for in a future update.

Plans:
* Add duration text potentially?
* *Proper* mobile support.

Issues:
* Can lag on note hit if too many noteDatas exist. (seems to happen on mobile more often, or maybe my phones lagging over time ðŸ˜­)
